Creating the linked website from scratch as a learning task, via the Odin Project.


Some issues I had and how I overcame them:

-Difficulty making the quote lighter weight. Solved by importing smaller weights of the Roboto font in the index page
    "link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100;300;400;500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">


What I would improve upon redoing this project:

-Consistency in naming conventions/selectors. I could tify up the CSS sheet by using better naming conventions for classes etc. For this project I was focusing more on getting the CSS to display properly, but next project I want to plan out the HTML structure better.

-I only started using developer tools towards the end of the project. This helped to establish element borders and padding etc. better.

-The website isn't responsive, and elements stretch/expand strangely. I believe this will be expanded further on in the Odin Project, so I've tried not to spend too much on this at this point. But it's something to be aware of.

TODO:

I've gotten what I need to out of this project, but if I return to it I'll address the following.

-Add footer
-Make page narrower and add black background
